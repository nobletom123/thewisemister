      <p class="descriptive-text-body">
        In order to protect The Wise Miser from widespread credit card fraud in travel bookings, we reserve the right to refuse payment by credit card over the phone or through a website booking.
      </p>
      <p class="descriptive-text-body">
        Any bookings made over the phone or through the website which we deem may be a security risk will be held on option for an agreed time to enable payment by the followng means:
      </p>
      <ul class="descriptive-text-list">
        <li>
          <b>Payment in Person</b> at our offices, Cardholders must present their payment card plus their passport for verification;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cleared funds</b> deposited into our bank account.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="descriptive-text-body">
        Please note that where the cardholder is not travelling or where the booking is for a destination with historically high levels of credit card fraud, this policy will be applied automatically.
