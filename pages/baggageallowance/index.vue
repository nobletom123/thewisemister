      <h1 class="descriptive-text-title">General Luggage Policies</h1>
      <p class="descriptive-text-body">All airlines place limits on the number, the size, and the weight of what you can carry on to a flight with you. Baggage rules can be complicated, and what is shown is a guide to the current allowances please note this does not mean the allowances shown apply to the ticket you purchase. Your consultant can confirm your baggage allowance at time of booking and this will be shown on your electronic flight ticket.</p>
      <p class="descriptive-text-body">Where possible, put all liquid items in your hand baggage. This includes water and other drinks, creams, sprays, pastes and gels. Liquids, gels and aerosols are only allowed in individual containers of 100ml. All containers must fit comfortably in one, transparent, re_sealable bag no larger than 20cm x 20cm (eg a freezer bag).</p>
      <h1 class="descriptive-text-title">Cabin Baggage Restrictions</h1>
      <p class="descriptive-text-body">Each passenger is restricted to carrying only one item of cabin baggage through the airport search point with a maximum size of 56cm x 45cm x 25cm. Other bags, such as handbags, may be carried within the single item of cabin baggage.</p>
      <h1 class="descriptive-text-title">Baggage policy of different airlines</h1>
      <p class="descriptive-text-body">Note that when maximum size measurements are shown as a total number of inches (eg 45") this is the total of the length, width and height of the piece. There are standard sets of dimensions that go to make up these totals (for example, 22 x 14 x 9 is the standard for 45") and if you have a bag that is an unusual shape but still within the total number of inches, you may find it being rejected.</p>
      <p class="descriptive-text-body">For complete up to date information we strongly recommend you visit the airline website directly, what is provided here is a guide and subject to change without notice and does not constitute a part of any flight sale contract made on this website.</p>
