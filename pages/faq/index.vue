      <h1 class="descriptive-text-title">How do I know if my booking is confirmed? Do I need to reconfirm my flight?</h1>
      <p class="descriptive-text-body">
        When you complete your booking, which will happen after you have submitted your credit card details and pressed the conﬁrm button, you will reach a booking conﬁrmation page on the website. Your booking is only complete once you reach this conﬁrmation page. You will then be sent a conﬁrmation e-mail shortly afterwards. Both the e-mail and the conﬁrmation page contain the details and price of your order, along with your reference number. You should quote this reference number if you need to get in touch with us, as it will help us to identify your order. If you do not see the conﬁrmation page or receive the e-mail, your booking may not have been conﬁrmed. There is no need to reconﬁrm your ﬂights before departure from the UK though you must reconﬁrm any onward or return ﬂights with the airline you are travelling with.

The airline you are ﬂying with stores all the ticket data on its computer, which means there is no paper ticket for you to collect and -more importantly - no ticket to lose. With an e-ticket, all you need to do is go straight to the check-in desk with a valid passport and a copy of the email conﬁrmation sent out by the wise miser conﬁrming your itinerary. Once these have been checked and veriﬁed, your boarding pass will be issued.
